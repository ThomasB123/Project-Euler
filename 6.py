# Sum square difference
'''
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

# Answer: 25164150

sumOfSquares = 0
squareOfSums = 0
for x in range(1,101):
    sumOfSquares += x**2
    squareOfSums += x
squareOfSums **= 2
print(squareOfSums-sumOfSquares)
